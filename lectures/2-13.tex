\section{February 13th -- Monticello's Body}

Monticello `virtual tour.' Monticello now has small acknowledgements to the slaves. A slave burial ground was discovered in 2001, and Jefferson's descendants voted to deny Sally Hemings' descendents being buried there. 5000 acres.

Monticello not what it appears to be -- hidden tunnels etc. Jefferson died ~4 million 2013 dollars in debt. Property structured like a big farm, not a plantation.

Jefferson was 2nd largest land/slave owner in Virginia. No slave cabins remain, just as no slave ships have survived. Alcove in Jefferson's bedroom large enough for a person, boarded up when news about Sally Hemings arose.

Jefferson burned all correspondances between himself and his wife when she died. Managed to erase Martha Jefferson's voice entirely.

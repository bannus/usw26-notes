\section{February 20th -- National Museum of African American History and Culture} 

\paragraph{Praxis} The process by which a theory or skill is practiced, becomes applied.

\begin{itemize}
  \item American narrative

  All four of Truillot's silences present. Bears the burder of being the ``official,'' or the government's version, of black history. Should the narrative be a story of pain, or highlight the uplifting part of the story. How should narrative end? With country overcoming racial history, or highlighting how racism is still a major problem?

  Only talking about one aspect silences the others. Answer from director: African-American culture used on lens to define what it means to be America.

  \item Politics of racial healing

  Located near the National Museum of American History: how to ensure that they are seen as complementary, rather than notably separate.

  \item Process of remembering
  \item Scarcity of sources

  Very few slave possessions surviving, can't have whole wall full of documents too. 

  Draw attention to the fact that pieces are missing -- ask what this means about the period. Have to be creative about the collection.

  \item Audience

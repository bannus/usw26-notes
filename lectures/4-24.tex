\section{April 24th -- ``Illegality'' and the Politics of Personhood}

Guest lecture by Sandy Placido.

Citizenship as means to belong. Belonging and Citizenship intertwined.

Immigrant rights are human rights. No human being is illegal. Art tends to be part of larger political strategies.

\paragraph{Cultural citizenship} Rosaldo prof at NYU. Emphasizes everyday cultural practices.

IIRAIRA: increased reasons you could be deported, limited relief to fight a deportation

9/11 just accelerated attack on non-citizens. People arrested in raids, deported, even though there were no terrorist connections. DHS formed, protects from terrorists, natural disasters.

\paragraph{Immigrant detention} Terrible thing. No accountability, no legal representation. Basically a prison.

\paragraph{287(g)} Gives local community-based agencies federal immigration power.

Secure communities started in 2008, spread across US. Getting arrested, fingerprints passed to DC to check your citizenship.

\paragraph{SB1070} 2010 Arizona law. Anyone suspected to be illegal immigrant can be asked to produce papers.

Problematic to call people ``illegal''. Associated Press Stylebook recomments against the phrase ``illegal immigrant'' by journalists in April 2013. People ``come out'' as undocumented.
